## How to setup

For this particular project the dependencies of the API and the client app are separated, so do the following:

- Execute `yarn` in the root folder
- `cd apps/client` and then install its dependencies running `yarn` again.
- `docker compose up -d` will create an image with the postgres database.
- Finally, run `yarn seed` to populate the database with fake `users` that you'll be able to use for testing.

## Start the application

- Run `yarn start:api` to start the API server.
- Run `yarn start:client` to start the client server.

## Explore the project graph
